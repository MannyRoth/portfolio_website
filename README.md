**Portfolio Website**

In this project I used HTML, CSS and Python (with some help from TreeHouse) to create a website to display some of my work.

**How to run the Website**
To run this site locally follow these steps

*Clone the project from github
*Create a virtual environment
    *Mac: python3 -m venv env
    *Windows: python -m venv env
*Activate your environment
    *Mac: source ./env/bin/activate
    *Windows: .\env\Scripts\activate

Install the required packages using pip install
Then in your terminal run 'python app.py'
