# Portfolio Website

In this project I used HTML, CSS and Python (with some help from TreeHouse) to create a website to display some of my work.

## How to run the Website
To run this site locally follow these steps<br>

* Clone the project from github<br>
* Create a virtual environment<br>
    * Mac: <code>python3 -m venv env</code><br>
    * Windows: <code>python -m venv env</code><br>
* Activate your environment<br>
    * Mac: <code>source ./env/bin/activate</code><br>
    * Windows: <code>.\env\Scripts\activate</code><br>

Install the required packages using <code>pip install</code><br>
Then in your terminal run <code>python app.py</code><br>

Its been a blast (and sometimes a pain) to learn Python and see myself grow over this course. It nice to have a place to show off some of my progress.<br> 
I used Python, HTML, CSS, and SQL Alchemy.<br>
